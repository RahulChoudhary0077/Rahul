          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The idea for Pdf-Converter was born out of frustration. We were tired of clunky software, expensive subscriptions, and services that compromised user privacy. We envisioned a platform that was not only free and easy to use but also respected user data by performing as many operations as possible directly in the browser. This commitment to client-side processing means your files stay on your computer, providing an unparalleled level of security and privacy.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Our Technology</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            We leverage cutting-edge web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and WebAssembly-powered libraries like pdf-lib to deliver a fast and reliable experience. By running complex operations in your browser, we minimize server costs and pass those savings on to youâ€”by keeping our core tools free. For more intensive tasks that require server power, we are building a secure and scalable backend infrastructure to handle them efficiently.
